### About
The code was written as part of my master thesis project, where I used neural networks to obtain optimal hedging strategies for a variety of option types in the Black-Scholes and Heston model.
The network structure is based on Mikko Pakkanens code and slides, and the Deep Hedging article by Buehler et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03042. 
Data from the Heston model was generated using the Broadie-Kaya exact simulation scheme, implemented in C++. 
The C++ code is based on Dave Roberts code found at: https://github.com/daleroberts/heston-qmc. 
It requires the package Boost found at https://www.boost.org/
